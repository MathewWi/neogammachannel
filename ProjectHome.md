# Wii-Style NeoGamma Backup Launcher Channel #

## Creating a Wii-Style NeoGamma Backup Launcher Channel and Forwarder. ##

### Fixed both Versions, now they are released in 1.0 version (thanks to josete2k from gbatemp.net) ###

All you have to do is to download the file you are interested in, put it into root:\WAD and install it with Waninkoko's Wad Manager.

No more known issues.
